            </div>
            <p>
              I was born on Augest 12, 1990 in a hospital in Stockton, California. However, six months later my parents deside to move to San Luis Obispo, California, and that is where I grew up. I have a father that is a pharmacist, a mother that is a teacher, and a younger brother. I went to Los Rancho Elementary, Laguna Middle School, San Luis High, Sonoma State University and finally Fullstack Academy for my education. As an inquisitive young man I loved science, alway trying to understand how things worked. I especially was fascinated by biology and technology. I have always been 'live could be better, but could be worse' kind of guy. I was never really the strongest or smartest, but what I lack in that I made up for in hardwork and sheer determination. As for my activities outside of school my parents tryed to keep me active so I played a lot of sports like soccer, football, rugby, skiing and track. I was also taught the piano at a young age. I then joined my schools band and played the clarinet and saxophone, it made playing in the marching band and playing football a bit tough though. If I didn't do this I would have propably played videogames all day, and for that I thank my parents. As for hobbies I like to program, hike, play videogames, go to the movies, tavel, write stories, or volenteer at the animal selter, what can I say I'm a dog person.

                I went to Sonoma State University, home of the sea wolves. Fun fact, we got our mascot based on a book "The Sea-Wolf". So unfortuately, a Sea Wolf is not a real animal. I would know, I graduated Sonoma State with a major in Biology and a minor in Chemestry. So knowing and understanding animals are kinda my thing.

              <h1>Fullstack Academy (2019)</h1>
              <p>
                I took Fullstack Academy seven month coding bootcamp course where I learned how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript together to make a full funtional web application. Our language was primarly in Javascript where I learned how to code on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. On the back-end I used Sequalized and postgres to manage my data tables and their relationships together. I created servers using Express and routes like .get, .put, .post, .delete to bring in my data. I was even taught security by hiding passwords and emails using hash&salt methods for login pages. On the front-end I was taught to use React and Axios and to use Webpack to tie in all of my pages together. Furthermore, I was also taught to use Redux so I can use my state outside of my App.js in the form of a store and using Axios to create thunks for the routes I created on the server page. I could go on but I will let my work on Github speak for me. From a guy who never coded before and had work to pay the bills; this bootcamp was hands down the hardest thing I ever did in my life. And it was soooo worth it.
